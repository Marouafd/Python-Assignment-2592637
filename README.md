The Python program generates three-letter abbreviations for tree names using a systematic, rule-driven approach. It processes data from two files: trees.txt, to extract and clean tree names, and values.txt, to associate letters with scores. Abbreviations are created by combining the first letter of a tree name with two consecutive letters, ensuring uniqueness and compliance with defined rules. Each abbreviation is scored based on letter positions and English frequency. Outputs include clear mappings like "ALD: Alder (Score: 27)" and "GRI: Grey Willow (Score: 43)," showcasing the program's precision. A robust unit test evaluates the core generate_abbreviations method, verifying accuracy through simulated input and output using Python's unittest framework. This enhances the tool's reliability, ensuring consistent and meaningful abbreviation generation.
